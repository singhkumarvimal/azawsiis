# Azure Virtual Machine Sizes Overview

Azure Virtual Machine (VM) sizes offer a wide range of options for hosting servers and workloads in the cloud, categorized into different families and types optimized for specific purposes. Users can select the most suitable VM size based on their requirements, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth.

## VM Size and Series Naming

Azure VM sizes follow specific naming conventions to denote varying features and specifications. Each character in the name represents different aspects of the VM, including the VM family, number of vCPUs, and extra features like premium storage or included accelerators.

## VM Size Families by Type

### General Purpose

*   **Description:** Provide balanced CPU-to-memory ratio. Ideal for testing and development, small to medium databases, and low to medium traffic web servers.
*   **Families:** A, B, D, DC

### Compute Optimized

*   **Description:** High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers.
*   **Families:** F, FX

### Memory Optimized

*   **Description:** High memory-to-CPU ratio. Great for relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics.
*   **Families:** E, Eb, EC, M

### Storage Optimized

*   **Description:** Offer high disk throughput and IO. Ideal for Big Data, SQL, NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and large transactional databases.
*   **Families:** L

### GPU Accelerated

*   **Description:** Specialized VMs with single, multiple, or fractional GPUs. Designed for compute-intensive, graphics-intensive, and visualization workloads.
*   **Families:** NC, ND, NG, NV

### FPGA Accelerated

*   **Description:** Specialized VMs with single or multiple FPGAs. Designed for compute-intensive workloads.
*   **Families:** NP

### High Performance Compute

*   **Description:** Optimized for various HPC workloads such as computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, frontend and backend EDA, rendering, molecular dynamics, computational geoscience, weather simulation, and financial risk analysis.
*   **Families:** HB, HC, HX
